        "CSR: Thank you for calling XYZ Internet Services, my name is Sarah. How may I help you today?",
        "Customer: Hi, I'm having a lot of issues with my internet. It's been down since yesterday, and I can't seem to fix it. I need it up as soon as possible because I work from home.",
        "CSR: I apologize for the inconvenience. I'd be happy to help resolve this. Can I have your name and account number to pull up your information?",
        "Customer: It's Jessica Davis. My account number is 789654123.",
        "CSR: Thank you, Ms. Davis. I see your account here. Can you confirm the address associated with the account?",
        "Customer: Yes, it's 123 Oak Street, Springfield.",
        "CSR: Perfect. I see that there is an outage reported in your area, which may be affecting your connection. Our technicians are working on it and the estimated time for service restoration is 3 hours.",
        "Customer: Three hours? That’s unacceptable! I need it back now. What can you do to fix this?",
        "CSR: I completely understand your frustration, and I wish there was more I could do immediately. Unfortunately, the outage is affecting multiple homes in your area. What I can do is escalate this issue for you to ensure it's prioritized.",
        "Customer: This is really inconvenient. Is there any compensation for this? I’ve been without internet for over a day now.",
        "CSR: I apologize again for the disruption, Ms. Davis. We can apply a credit to your next bill for the downtime you've experienced. Would that be acceptable?",
        "Customer: I guess that’s better than nothing. How much will the credit be?",
        "CSR: Based on the duration of the outage, the credit would be $25 applied to your next statement.",
        "Customer: Alright, fine. But make sure it gets fixed soon. If it isn’t up in three hours, I’m going to be furious.",
        "CSR: I understand, Ms. Davis. I’ve escalated your case, and our team is working to get it resolved as quickly as possible. I’ll also follow up with you via email once the issue is resolved. Do you have any other questions?",
        "Customer: No, just fix the internet.",
        "CSR: Thank you for your patience, and we appreciate you being a valued customer. We’ll make sure to keep you updated, and I hope your service is restored soon."
